# Chatta-what?

Chattanooga, fondly known as the 'nooga. Chattanooga is home to a number of great startups, a fantastic outdoor scene, delicious food and the best whiskey. 

# Whats the point of this?

It’s no secret that web software is making its way into every part of our lives. We want to make it easy for Engineers, Journalists & Founders to see whats happening in Chattanooga.
